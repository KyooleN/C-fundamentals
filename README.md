# Hello everyone! 🍾 🥳  
## Here are the Algorithms and Data Structures activities in C that I did throughout my first term at College.
Unfortunately, most, if not all of them are in <b>portuguese</b> 😞. When doing activities that are not related to College I'll make sure to write the <code>code</code> in <b>english</b> 😄.

# Thank you for taking your time to see my learning process :)
